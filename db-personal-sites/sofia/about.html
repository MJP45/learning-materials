            <p>Welcome to my website!</p>

            <p>I am Sofia and to summarise who I am; I am Finnish, an intersectional feminist, a passionate reader and someone who loves to travel.</p>

            <p>Although I am from Finland, I have grown-up across the world, having lived in eight countries spanning three continents. 
                For this reason, I find it difficult to solely identify with being Finnish, which is why the question of; "where are you from?"
                always spurs me into a nervous panic.</p>

            <p>Among other things, I enjoy reading loads, listening to hours of podcasts (mainly on politics),
               and trying out all types of food from around the world.</p>
