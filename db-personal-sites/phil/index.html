                <p>Leaving University I joined IBM's graduate scheme as an "IT Consultant." I stayed with IBM for 4 years, working on projects whereby I supported client applications. Each role required little technical ability, but prioritised client handling soft skills. </p>

                <h3>Nomura</h3>
                <p>After leaving IBM, I joined Investment Banking working for Nomura. For 3 years, I worked as an Application Support Specialist for the Equity Derivatives asset class. I worked alongside front office traders in a high pressure environment, ensuring the applications they use to trade and hedge risk were stable whilst investigating any risk or pricing issues.</p>
