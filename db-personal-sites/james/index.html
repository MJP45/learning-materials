This website has been constructed using HTML, CSS and JavaScript only. Over the coming weeks, I will update the site with new features to improve both appearance and the delivery of information. For now, the website contains information about me. Read below to find out more!</p>

                <h3>Who is James?</h3>
                <p class = "main_about_txt">I grew up in a suburb of Dublin (Ireland) named Kilbarrack. I went to school in North Dublin and attended university at Trinity College Dublin. Graduating in 2015 with a degree in Natural Science (Geology), I then moved to the UK to study for a Masters in Hydrogeology at University of Birmingham. Following the completion of my studies, I moved to Cambridge (UK) to work as a Hydrogeologist with Mott MacDonald Ltd. For three years I worked on a wide range of projects from contamination risk assessments, groundwater models, strategic water company investment planning and took on various project management roles. In my spare time, I taught myself Python with the intention of automating a number of work processes. Computer programming became the most enjoyable part of my job and I begin exploring the language more and taking on personal projects at home (such as creating my own game). Eventually, I decided I wanted more from my job and that a career in software development was for me! I quit my job, moved to London and was fortunate enough to get a place on the _nology Tech Accelerator programme!  You can find out more about me on this website.<a href="about.html"> Read more...</a></p>

                <h3>What interests James?</h3>
                <p class = "main_about_txt">I keep active as much as I can! I enjoy swimming but hiking is my favourite activity. Even a short walk around a new place can be a mini-adventure. Since moving to London, I have enjoyed exploring the city by going for long walks. While at home I love watching TV series on repeat, finding new films to watch and playing video games. PlayStation 4 is currently my console of choice but old-school Nintendo games will always be my favourite! While not staring at a screen, I enjoy reading and baking. To find out more about each of these, keep reading the website!<a href="interests.html">Read more...</a></p>
