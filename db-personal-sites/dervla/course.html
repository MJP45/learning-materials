                <p>Q1: Why did I apply for this course?<br><br>I was thinking of moving into the software development field after I really enojyed the work I did in data analytics at PwC. I wanted something a little more technical and also creative. I am also very interested in working in finance and seeing what new changes emerging tech will bring into the banking sector. </p>

                <p>Q2: What excites me most about this course? <br><br>I am excited to start learing the core skills I need to work as a software developer, and be able to design and bring my own creations to life! Every company needs software developers; be it Google, Facebook or even Disney or Playstation. I also think it will be great to work alongside you all and be able to support eachother on the next step of our careers.</p>

                <p>Q3: What do I think the main challenges will be? <br><br>I know from experience that when coding goes wrong, it can be very frustrating! So I think my main challenge will be to condition my mind to think like a developer, and remain calm to de-bug any potential problems that I encounter. There is always a solution to the problem, so I just need to find a logic way to find it!</p>

                <p>Q4: What do I see myself doing in 5 years time?<br><br>Hopefully I will be a more experienced developer, working for Deutsche Bank in London. One of the great things about coding is that you never stop learning, so I hope I will be continuing to develop and fine tune my skills to become a better designer. Hopefully I can also help others around me with my experience and maybe mentor other girls who are interested in learning to code.</p>
