                <p>I grew up in Radlett, Hertfordshire with my parents and two younger sisters.<br><br>I went to the
                    local
                    primary school and then to two different Jewish secondary schools in North London. I studied
                    Economics and Politics with North American Studies at Leeds University and spent my third year of
                    that course studying at the University of Toronto in Canada.<br><br>Since leaving university, I have
                    settled in London - first in Hendon and now Edgware.</p>

                <p>I met my wife, Roz, at university when we were both 19 (she is two days older than me!). At 24 we
                    moved in together and at 28 we married. We have a wonderful daughter, Amy, who is
                    12.<br><br>Roz
                    is a fluent French speaker (she studied it at university) and currently works part-time for the
                    Catholic Church in their property department. Her previous career (pre-Amy) was as a project manager
                    for the civil service.<br><br>Amy is just about to go into Year 8 of secondary school (<a
                        href="https://jcoss.org/" target="_blank">JCoSS</a>). She has also
                    just celebrated her Bat Mitzvah (Jewish coming of age celebration). Outside school she loves to
                    pursue dancing, singing and drama.

                <h2 id="hobbies">Hobbies/Interests</h2>
                <p>My primary hobby is cycling and all the tech and stats that go with it. I have cycled 4000+ miles
                    this year so far and by the time you read this I should have completed an additional 1000 miles
                    cycling end to end of the country (Land&apos;s End to John o&apos;Groats).<br><br>I love the stats and tech
                    that can
                    go along with cycling. When riding, I measure my heart rate, power, cadence, speed and location
                    (GPS). All this is uploaded to <a href="https://www.strava.com/athletes/1253381"
                        target="_blank">Strava</a>.
                    Off the
                    bike, I also wear an Apple Watch to measure my exercise/workouts and I measure my
                    sleep with a gadget under my mattress (<a href="https://www.beddit.com/"
                        target="_blank">Beddit</a>)!
                    <br><br>Aside from all that, I have managed to
                    accumulate a number of categories on my driving licence. I am qualified to ride/drive a
                    motorcycle,
                    car and <a href="https://www.hgvtrainingcentre.co.uk/hgv-training-cat-c-licence/"
                        target="_blank">rigid lorry</a> (I failed my <a

                <h2 id="experience">Experience</h2>
                <p>I have worked in technology in the banking sector since leaving university. First for HSBC, then
                    Morgan Stanley and finally Deutsche Bank, where I have been since 2007. In the middle of all of
                    that,
                    I had a short stint as a lorry driver (hence the lorry licence)!
                    <br><br>The first part of my career was
                    primarily hands-on and technical using various technologies (VB, Java, C#, SQL) and the second half
                    has been focused more on project and team management and business analysis. For more details of my
                    career history, see my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/simonfreedland/"
                        target="_blank">LinkedIn profile</a>.</p>

                <h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2>
                <p>My happiest times in my career were when I was writing code which provided a very direct line of
                    sight to the delivery of value to the business. Until this
                    opportunity with _nology (<a
                        href="https://www.nology.io/applicants/deutsche-bank-tech-accelerator-programme"
                        target="_blank">Deutsche Bank Tech Accelerator Programme</a>) was offered, I never thought there
                    was an avenue back into a technical
                    career for me.
                    <br><br>I am excited to be able to throw myself into learning new skills and technologies
                    with similarly motivated colleagues, and to reset my career as a software engineer.</p>
